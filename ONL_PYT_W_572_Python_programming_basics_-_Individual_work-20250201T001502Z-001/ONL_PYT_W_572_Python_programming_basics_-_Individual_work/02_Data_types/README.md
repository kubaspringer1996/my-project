## Exercise 1 &ndash; Data types

In the file `task.py`, create 4 variables (with arbitrary names) and insert the following data into them:

* an integer,
* a floating point number,
* a string,
* a logical value.

Display each variable on the screen, in the following format:
`Variable XXX has value YYY`.


## Exercise 2 &ndash; Boolean values

Create three variables in the file `task.py`:
 - `foo` with the value `True` (of the **bool** type)
 - `bar` with the value `False` (of the **bool** type)
 - `check` which will contain the result of comparing `foo` and `bar` using the operator `==`

Use the function `print` to display the value of the variable `check` on the screen:
```
Variable check has value ???
```


## Exercise 3 &ndash; Adding

Create the following variables in the file `task.py`:

 - `add1` with integer value,
 - `add2` with floating point value,
 - `result` which will be the sum of `add1` and `add2`.

Display the result on the screen. 

Example (when `add1` is 10 and `add2` is 2.5):
```
12.5
```


## Exercise 4 &ndash; Mathematical operations

Create two variables in the file `task.py`: `a1` and `a2`, with values `25` and `10` respectively, and display them on the screen. Then calculate:

* the sum of `a1` and `a2`, and store it in the variable `sum_value`,
* the quotient of `a1` and `a2`, and store it in the variable `quotus`,
* the integer part of variable `quotus` and store it in variable `int_part`; make sure it is of the `int` type.

Display the values of all variables in the terminal.

Example of the text printed in the terminal:
```
25
10
35
2.5
2
```


## Exercise 5 &ndash; Adding elements to a list

In the file `task.py`:

* Define an **empty** list named `animals`.
* Add the names of at least three fairytale animals that you know to the list.
* Display the list after each operation.

Use the `append` method to add elements.


## Exercise 6 &ndash; List of numbers

* In a variable named `numbers`, store a list consisting of numbers from 1 to 8.
* Output the second last element of the list on the screen.

> ###### Hint: use reverse indexing.


## Exercise 7 &ndash; Retrieving elements from a list

Look in file `task.py`, there is a list defined:
```python
characters = ["Harry", "Ron", "Hermione"]
```

* display the first element of the list in the console,
* display the last element of the list in the console.

2 lines should be displayed in the console:
```
Harry
Hermione
```

> ###### Hint: use reverse indexing to retrieve the last element.
